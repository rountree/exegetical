An example module for event subscription and logging.

Intended order of operations:

./salloc.sh
./flux.sh
./load.sh
./unload.sh

First version that works with variorum JSON API, tested on 2 nodes on quartz.
Variorum returns multiple samples in the JSON object.
TODO: Aggregation

Currently dumps every sample to KVS. NOT SCALABLE. 

Can be examined with.
flux kvs ls
flux kvs get rank.0.sample.<id>
