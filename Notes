Notes from Patki, Aug 3, 2020:
Latest update: Aug 4, 2020.

--done: 
Write permissions to the repo.

--done; flux kvs ls, flux kvs get 
How do we check KVS actively?

--done; use flux_log
How do I see output from all hosts? Only one hostname is getting reported. Need
to test this. 

--done; ensure MOD_NAME is correct at EOF.
Why isn't unload.sh detecting my module? 


Where should we be aggregating? 

How do we end the timer loop? Seems to run indefintely, which seems like 
expected behavior, but I'm unsure how to capture agggregation with this at 
the moment. 

Once this works on Quartz, we need to move to Lassen and change the scripts 
to do lalloc. 

Ask Dong as to how he wants the Flux module to be production ready, and how
it should be released. We may have to add new scripts and guidelines to release
the "flux-power" module within the flux-framework... (Mark suggested a separate 
sub-repo with a module).
