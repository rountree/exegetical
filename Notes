Notes from Patki:

How do we check KVS actively?

How do we end the timer loop? Seems to run indefintely, which seems like 
expected behavior, but I'm unsure how to capture agggregation with this at 
the moment. 

Why isn't unload.sh detecting my module? 

Where should we be aggregating? 

Once this works on Quartz, we need to move to Lassen and change the scripts 
to do lalloc. 

Ask Dong as to how he wants the Flux module to be production ready, and how
it should be released. We may have to add new scripts and guidelines to release
the "flux-power" module within the flux-framework....
